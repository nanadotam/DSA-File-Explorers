Some ideas I had

- This class will manage the root directory and provide methods for file and directory operations.

```java
public class CommandParser {
    private VirtualFileSystem vfs;

    public CommandParser(VirtualFileSystem vfs) {
        this.vfs = vfs;
    }

    public void parseCommand(String command) {
        // Parse and execute commands
    }
}
```
