# Meeting Notes

1. Tree being independent of the code. -- we can implement it later
2. Different file types and different file types -> Files attributes: we have file name and file type
   a. Diirectory class
   b. File class (but has a file type) 
3. Each file different class (maybe 5 file directories)

## Command line code
1. Command interface then we create command classes from that

# COnclusion 
- What was established
  1. We need a file class
  2. Directory class
  3. And tree data structure
  4. Might be the need for UML diagram
