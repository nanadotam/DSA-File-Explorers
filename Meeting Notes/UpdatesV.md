# Changes made
- Changed DirectoryNode to Folder
- Created parent class FileExplorerElement (extended by both File and Folder). Idea is that TreeNode will be of type FileExplorerElement
- Modifications to File and Folder because of parent class introduction
- Tweaked Directory file because of changes made. Unsure about implementation
- Also unsure about implementation

# Essentially Complete (Up for review)

- FileExplorerElement
- File
- Folder

# Look at
